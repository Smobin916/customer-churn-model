# Interconnect Telecom Client Churn Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast client churn for the telecom operator **Interconnect**. Identifying users who plan to leave will enable the company to offer promotional codes and tailored plan options, potentially retaining customers. The data includes personal information about clients, details of their contracts, and services used.

## Features
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data quality by checking for consistency, completeness, and accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzing client demographics and service preferences.
  - Identifying patterns in churn behavior.
  - Visualizing correlations between contract types, services, and churn rates.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Leveraging classification models to identify churn-prone users.
  - Evaluating models using metrics like AUC-ROC and accuracy.

## Tools and Techniques
1. **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
2. **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Creating insightful visualizations to support data exploration.
3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
   - Models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost for classification.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to enhance performance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Primary**: AUC-ROC for assessing model effectiveness.
   - **Secondary**: Accuracy to supplement the evaluation.

## How to Run the Analysis Locally
To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interconnect-churn-forecasting.git
   cd interconnect-churn-forecasting

**Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

**Install Dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Notebook: Open Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE and execute the scripts for data analysis and modeling.

**Dataset Information**
The dataset includes:

contract.csv: Details about client contracts.

personal.csv: Client demographics and personal data.

internet.csv: Information on internet services used.

phone.csv: Details about telephone services.

Target Feature: The column EndDate indicates churn, where No means the client is active.

Deployment
The finalized model can be deployed on platforms like Flask or FastAPI to integrate real-time churn predictions into Interconnect's systems.
